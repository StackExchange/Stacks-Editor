There is a **code detection plugin** active in this editor that will intercept image uploads and simulate image code detection.<br />
If code is detected, the plugin will ask the user if they want to upload images as a code block instead of an image.
Try it out by clicking the image menu item above 🏞️.

And here's a plugin that (sorta) adds [Japanese.SE furigana support](https://japanese.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/806/how-should-i-format-my-questions-on-japanese-language-se/807#807):

`感``{かん}じる` renders as 感{かん}じる. すごい!

There's also a very silly plugin set in the 🤘 menu. Try it out!
