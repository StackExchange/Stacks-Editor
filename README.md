```

```js
import { StacksEditor } from "@stackoverflow/stacks-editor";

## Development

1. Install dependencies with `npm i`
2. Build and start using `npm start`
3. Your browser will show the example page automatically

## Run Tests

Run all unit tests (no end-to-end tests) using

    npm test

Run all end-to-end tests (written in Playwright) using

    npm run test:e2e

End-to-end tests need to follow the convention of using `someName.e2e.test.ts` as their filename. They'll automatically get picked up by the test runner this way.

### Debug End-to-end tests

Understanding why end-to-end tests fail can be tricky business. There are a few ways to get a glimpse of playwright's internals:

1. Activate debug logging
   With debug logging enabled, Playwright will log whatever it's currently trying to do or waiting for to the console. Activate it by running `DEBUG=pw:api npm run test:e2e`

2. Show the browser window
   By default, playwright starts a headless browser to make things fast. If you want to follow along, you can tell playwright to show you the browser window. Go to `jest-playwright.config.js` and uncomment the block containing the `headless: false` setting.

## Browser Bundle analysis

Generate a `stats.json` file for analysis using

    npm run print-stats

You can upload your `stats.json` file [here](http://webpack.github.io/analyse/) or [here](https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/) for visualization. See more resources [here](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#bundle-analysis).
