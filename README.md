## Development

1. Install dependencies with `npm i`
2. Build and start using `npm start`
3. Point your browser to the address listed in the output - typically <http://localhost:8080/>

## Run Tests

Run all unit tests (no end-to-end tests) using

    npm run test:unit

Run all end-to-end tests (written in Playwright) using

    npm run test:e2e

End-to-end tests need to follow the convention of using `someName.e2e.test.ts` as their filename. They'll automatically get picked up by the test runner this way.

## Browser Bundle analysis

Generate a `stats.json` file for analysis using

    npm run build:stats

You can upload your `stats.json` file [here](http://webpack.github.io/analyse/) or [here](https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/) for visualization. See more resources [here](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#bundle-analysis).

## Publishing

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to automatize the steps necessary to publish to NPM, create GH releases and a changelog.

- Every time you do work that requires a new release to be published, [add a changesets entry](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) by running `npx @changesets/cli` and follow the instructions on screen. (changes that do not require a new release - e.g. changing a test file - don't need a changeset).
    - When opening a PR without a corresponding changeset the [changesets-bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) will remind you to do so. It generally makes sense to have one changeset for PR (if the PR changes do not require a new release to be published the bot message can be safely ignored)
- The [release github workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) continuously check if there are new pending changesets in the main branch, if there are it creates a GH PR (`chore(release)` [see example](https://github.com/StackExchange/apca-check/pull/2)) and continue updating it as more changesets are potentially pushed/merged to the main branch.
- When we are ready to cut a release we need to simply merge the `chore(release)` PR back to main and the release github workflow will take care of publishing the changes to NPM and create a GH release for us. The `chore(release)` PR also give us an opportunity to adjust the automatically generated changelog when necessary (the entry in the changelog file is also what will end up in the GH release notes).

_The release github workflow only run if the CI workflow (running linter, formatter and tests) is successful: CI is blocking accidental releases_.

_Despite using changesets to communicate the intent of creating releases in a more explicit way, we still follow [conventional commits standards](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for keeping our git history easily parseable by the human eye._

### Beta publishing

We use Changesets in prerelease mode to manage publishing to the beta branch. For more information, please refer to the official [Changesets prerelease documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/prereleases.md).

To prepare a beta release, follow these steps:

1. Create a pull request (PR) targeting the beta branch.

2. Ensure your PR includes a changeset.

3. Merging the PR will trigger the release-beta workflow. This workflow creates or updates a chore(new-beta-release) PR.

4. To cut a new beta release, merge the chore(new-beta-release) PR and wait for the `Release Beta` workflow to complete.

Consumers can install the beta package by targeting the beta tag:
`npm install @stackoverflow/stacks-editor@beta`
